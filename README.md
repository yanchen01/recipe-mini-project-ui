========================================================

This project is about learning how to design and implement a recipe calories cross-platform mobile app in React Native. We have decided to choose React Native as our UI framework and Express + Node.js as our backend API framework. React Native is robust and cross-platform, and also supports lots of packages. Express + Node.js provides an easy setup and lightweight packages, which is also one of the fastest backend frameworks.

We also included *Github Actions* to deploy our Backend API automatically to Heroku (where we host our backend API).
